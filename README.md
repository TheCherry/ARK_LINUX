# SOME FIXES
###Generating report for minidump  
Don’t click into the loading screen, just wait until the game is loaded.

### FPS
Start the game with this:  
-USEALLAVAILABLECORES -nomansky -SM4

### Freeze
~~Give your system more Swap! Best is on SSD.~~  
There are no realy fix, Swap can delay the freeze start, but the whole system freeze anyway, sometimes.  
To break a freeze: **CTRL+ALT+F1** and back to **CTRL+ALT+ F7 / F8** or login by *F1* and kill ARK with htop.
